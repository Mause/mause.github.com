## Me

Hi, my name is Elliana, and I'm a trans woman, and a software developer. I'm currently <span id="age">twenty three</span> years old, and failed out of *Curtin University* at 20 before starting work at Bankwest at their Perth head office. I've been playing around with Python since I was 13, and use Java and TypeScript heavily at work.

I am still finding myself.
