## Me


I am currently <span id="age">twenty one</span> years old, and attended *Margaret River Senior High School* from <date>2009</date> through <date>2013</date>, before attending the *Curtin University of Technology* at their Bentley campus in Perth for a number of years.
As someone who is half swiss, I do not speak very much swiss-german at all, though I can get by a little. 
I used to hate speaking to people I did not know/was unfamiliar with; stage fright, to a point, but am now more-or-less over that. Still hate speaking to people on the phone though :P (or, for what it's worth, in front of an audience). I have lived in Perth for nearly 4 years.

I am still finding myself.
