## Me

I am currently <span id="age">seventeen</span> years old, am sometimes afraid of raising my voice to be heard, and for years <date>2009</date> through <date>2013</date> attended *Margaret River Senior High School*.
I am half swiss but do not speak very much swiss-german at all, and defy the stereotype of being good at math as a "nerd".
I hate speaking to people I do not know/am unfamiliar with; stage fright, to a point.
A simple handshake usually clears that right up though.
