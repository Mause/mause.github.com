## Me

I am currently <span id="age">seventeen</span> years old, am sometimes afraid of raising my voice to be heard, and for years <date>2009</date> through <date>2013</date> attended *Margaret River Senior High School*.
I am now proudly attending the Curtin University of Technology at their Bently campus in Perth.
As someone who is half swiss, I do not speak very much swiss-german at all. According to some, I defy the stereotype of being good at math as a "nerd".
English is also not my strength, though most people don't seem to guess this speaking to me.
Spelling and grammar and all that hullablloo is fine however.
I hate speaking to people I do not know/am unfamiliar with; stage fright, to a point.
A simple handshake usually clears that right up though.
