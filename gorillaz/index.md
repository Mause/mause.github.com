# Gorillaz

I have been a Gorillaz fan for many a year, and have acquired some digital materials that aren't sold per se, and as such are somewhat difficult to obtain. Some of such are listed and linked below.

## Pirate Radio

I am unsure exactly many episodes exist; the earlier I am aware of is the five for Plastic Beach.

The first four are roughly half an hour long, 

 * [Episode 1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17607607/Gorillaz/Pirate%20Radio/01%20Episode%201.mp3)
 * [Episode 2](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17607607/Gorillaz/Pirate%20Radio/01%20Episode%202.mp3)
 * [Episode 3](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17607607/Gorillaz/Pirate%20Radio/01%20Episode%203.mp3)
 * [Episode 4](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17607607/Gorillaz/Pirate%20Radio/01%20Episode%204.mp3)

And [episode 5](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17607607/Gorillaz/Pirate%20Radio/01%20Episode%205.mp3), with an extended one and a half hour version available if you progress farth enough in the game on the website at the time.

There are also a number of others; for the singles collection, a few for the release of the converse shoes and associated song, Do Ya Thing.

## Windows Theme

Difficult to obtain, seeing as [Gorillaz.com](http://gorillaz.com) is deteriorating with age, and that you must access the website with IE to make the website let you download it. This is as it was part of a promotional partnership for IE9.

The [theme](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17607607/Gorillaz/IE9Gorill.theme) contains a number of sound effects for actions and errors, and a number of backgrounds.
