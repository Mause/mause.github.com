        A table selection webapp, originally written in ad-hoc jQuery.
        Hosted on [Heroku](http://ball.mause.me)
        This was originally written for my year 12 ball of 2013, where the
        traditional method had been to pin a sheet of paper on an accessable
        wall at school, and allow some people to pick where they would sit, and
        for other people to screw around and mess everyones seating up.

        Essentially an experiment to see how much I had learnt from building
        Table Select Web. Standalone blog viewing is possible, but viewing a
        users dashboard is not due to limitations in Tumblr API authentication
        system, and that I wanted to keep the app purely client side.

        Thus far my single commission work, though the comissioner never got
        around to actually providing any art to be displayed on the site.
        Front end ain't pretty, but the backend uses the Google data API to
        pull image URL's from Google Web Albums.
