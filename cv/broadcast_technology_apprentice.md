#### Cover letter for Broadcast Technology Apprentice application


To whom it may concern,

I wish to apply for the Broadcast Technology Apprentice position at your Bunbury station, as I believe I possess the qualities and skills listed as being required in the job description.

For your consideration I have submitted my CV, and contained within that, two references; one from the Computer Technician at Margaret River Senior High School, Mr. Garry Pusey, and the other from the principal of my primary school, both pertaining to my technical prowess/knowledge.

From a young age at primary school I began to explore electronics, having received an electronics kit from my parents sometime following. Some years later, having assisted teachers at my primary school with both computers and the school multimedia and sound systems, I received my first two computers from the school; both had been completely wiped, so I had to reinstall from scratch using resources from the local library. In later years, a friend and I received tutoring on the schools sound and lighting systems from the then music and the arts teacher Mr. Elliot Morris. Both the local public library and the library of Western Australia occupied significant portions of time in my youth, both on the subject of computers and electronics. Two particular volumes, looking back at my checkout history stand out; "Radio communication handbook" and "Beginner's guide to ham radio" by Len Buckwalter, both eagerly devoured at age 10. Among these volumes were a number of "How Things Work" books, and several books on electronic theory and terminology. Once in High School, I joined the IT Club, built my first website on an old workstation, and later built my first computer from spare parts within the school.

One thing to note, however, is that at this time I possess only a Learners Permit, as opposed to a full drivers license, and it will be some before I can drive without supervision.

Looking forward to speaking to you again,
