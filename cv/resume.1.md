`elliana_may` [<var>optional</var>...] <var>flags</var>

## DESCRIPTION
I am a Senior Software Developer, with 6+ years of Java microservices experience, including supporting production
applications, remediating incidents, and building bespoke DevOps tooling to support application development and BAU.
I am passionate about building tools to help other software developers do their job better and easier, and mentoring 
developers on how to increase their productivity and on how to solve problems in ways that help them think outside the
box.
