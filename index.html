    <h3>Prelude</h3>
    <p>
        I guess I fit into a surprisingly large group of people who are presumed to be smarter than they actually are.
        People constantly presume my computer skill<span title="z?">s</span> to be greater than they are, or that because I have computer skills that I am automatically the best at everything. This could not be further from the truth.
        <br/>
        Regardless, I do have some skill of the aforementioned; you could look at some of the code I have written and/or contributed over on <a href="http://github.com/Mause">GitHub</a>, or look at some <a href="/projects">projects</a> I have attempted in the past.
        If you need to contact me, my <a href=#>Facebook</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/110662837269852479292">Google Plus</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Lord_DeathMatch">Twitter</a> accounts are good points of contact.
        My <a href="http://mause.me/blogs">blogs</a>, too. Though, of course, you could always just <a href="mailto:me@mause.me">email me</a>.

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
        I am currently <span id="age">seventeen</span> years old, am sometimes afraid of raising my voice to be heard, and am attending the local senior high school.
        I concluded my schooling at <span title="Margaret River Senior High School">M.R.S.H.S.</span> on the <time datetime="2013-10-25">25/10/2013</time>; during that year I took the following: Math 2C/D, Computer Science 3A/B, <span title="this subject was more or less a 'filler' subject, to be honest">Biology 3A/B</span>, and Food Science <span title="?">1C/D</span>.
        I am <span title="fyi">half swiss</span> but do not speak very much swiss-german at all, and defy the stereotype of being good at math as a <span title="usually refers to someone good at/experienced at the use of computers at a minute level">"nerd"</span>.
        I hate speaking to people I do not know/am unfamiliar with; stage fright, to a point.
        A simple handshake usually clears that right up though.
