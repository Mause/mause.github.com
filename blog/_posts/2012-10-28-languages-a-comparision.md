When I try to write code in C, I feel like I’m in a steel cage.
I move one finger wrong, and it’s as though C will bite it off.
So I have to try and move ever so carefully, making sure that no rogue characters end up in the centre of the code; a simple misplaced comma or colon can break an entire program and make my constructed world “go to shit”.

When i write code in Python, i feel as though the world is revolving around me, moving into place; the keys feel as though are moving on their own beneath my fingers.
The code flows beautifully from the mind to the keyboard, my idea’s transpired into machine form :)
