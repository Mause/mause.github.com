## Projects

Much of the code I have written is in Python, as is it both my language of choice, and the language with which I possess the most experience, having learnt Python through the [NCSS Challenge](https://groklearning.com/challenge/) of 2009, at age 13. Some years later, I learnt Javascript, and used it to add functionality to some websites.

For much of these projects, more information is available on the linked GitHub pages, where appropriate.

#### [PyALP:](https://github.com/Mause/PyALP) <small>Python (Django), HTML, CSS, Javascript</small>
An idiotic attempt at porting the '04 era PHP application for managing lan parties ALP, primarily for use at [RFLAN](http://rflan.org/).

#### [DoSH:](https://github.com/Mause/DoSH) <small>C</small>
A stupid shell written in C for the [DCPU16 platform](http://dcpu.com/)

#### [Project ByTeMoRe:](bytemore) <small>BASIC, Python</small>
A microcontroller based multimedia controller

#### [dcputoolchain-module-site:](http://github.com/Mause/dcputoolchain-module-site) <small>Python</small>
A basic proxy for the [GitHub API](http://developer.github.com/), with some basic search functionality bolted on top.

#### [Tyrian:](https://github.com/Mause/tyrian) <small>Python, LISP</small>
A moderately simple and largely incomplete implementation of [LISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) in Python, compiling into Python Bytecode. The writeup and documentation for the project can be found here at the [tyrian subdomain](http://tyrian.mause.me/).

#### [Mausembler:](https://github.com/Mause/mausemblr) <small>Python</small>
A failed attempt at writing an assembler for the [DCPU16 platform](http://dcpu.com). See below for another attempt in C++, Jupiter

#### [Jupiter:](https://github.com/Mause/jupiter) <small>C++</small>
My second (or third, depending on who's asking) attempt at an assembler, still a work in progress, so we shall see how I go

#### [tf-idf:](https://github.com/Mause/tf-idf) <small>Python</small>
Search engine algorithm for my [NCSS Summer School](http://www.ncss.edu.au/summer_school/index.html) project. Named after the algorithm which was used, so quite unoriginal :P

#### [Table Select Web:](https://github.com/Mause/table_select_web) <small>Python, Javascript</small>
A table selection webapp, originally written in ad-hoc jQuery. Hosted on [Heroku](http://ball.mause.me)
This was originally written for my year 12 ball of 2013, where the traditional method had been to pin a sheet of paper on an accessable wall at school, and allow some people to pick where they would sit, and for other people to screw around and mess everyones seating up.

#### [Tumblr Ember:](https://github.com/Mause/tumblr-ember) <small>Javascript</small>
Essentially an experiment to see how much I had learnt from building Table Select Web.
Standalone blog viewing is possible, but viewing a users dashboard is not due to limitations in Tumblr API authentication system, and that I wanted to keep the app purely client side.

#### [Micheal Nikulinsky's Art:](http://www.michealnikulinsky.com/) <small>Python</small>
Thus far my single commission work, though the comissioner never got around to actually providing any art to be displayed on the site.
Front end ain't pretty, but the backend uses the Google data API to pull image URL's from Google Web Albums.
