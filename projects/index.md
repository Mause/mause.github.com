## Projects

Much of my code is written in Python, as is it both my language of choice, and the language with which I possess the most experience.
I learnt Python through the [NCSS Challenge](https://groklearning.com/challenge/) of 2009, at age 13

For much of these projects, more information is available on the linked GitHub pages, where appropriate.

#### [DoSH:](http://github.com/Mause/DoSH)
A stupid shell written in C for the [DCPU16 platform](http://dcpu.com/)

#### [Project ByTeMoRe:](bytemore)
A microcontroller based multimedia controller

#### [dcputoolchain-module-site:](http://github.com/Mause/dcputoolchain-module-site)
A basic proxy for the [GitHub API](http://developer.github.com/), with some basic search functionality bolted on top.

#### [Tyrian:](https://github.com/Mause/tyrian)
A moderately simple and largely incomplete implementation of [LISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) in Python, compiling into Python Bytecode.

#### [tf-idf:](http://github.com/Mause/tf-idf)
Originally written for the my [NCSS Summer School]()

#### [Table Select Web:](http://github.com/Mause/table_select_web)
A table selection webapp, originally written in ad-hoc jQuery. Hosted on [Heroku](http://ball.mause.me)

#### [Tumblr Ember:](http://github.com/Mause/tumblr-ember)
Essentially an experiment to see how much I had learnt from building Table Select Web. Atomic blog viewing is possible, but viewing a users dashboard is not due to authentication limitations.
